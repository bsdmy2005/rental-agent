## Cover Image Suggestions

### Option 1: Abstract Network Visualization
**Visual Concept:**
- Network of interconnected nodes (representing sub-agents)
- Some nodes highlighted in different colors (different agent types)
- Subtle financial elements (currency symbols, payment arrows) integrated
- Modern, clean design with gradient background
- Text overlay: "Autonomous Agents | Real Payments | Real Learnings"

**Style:** Modern tech illustration, blue/purple gradient, minimalist
**Dimensions:** 1200x627px (LinkedIn recommended)

### Option 2: Split Screen Concept
**Visual Concept:**
- Left side: Traditional manual process (stack of papers, calculator, calendar)
- Right side: Autonomous agent network (flowing data, automated processes)
- Arrow or transition between them
- Clean, professional aesthetic

**Style:** Infographic-style, professional color scheme
**Text:** "From Manual to Autonomous"

### Option 3: Guardrails & Boundaries
**Visual Concept:**
- Central element: Bank account or payment symbol
- Surrounding it: Guardrail/boundary lines forming a protective structure
- Small agent icons positioned within the boundaries
- Subtle tech/AI elements (circuit patterns, data flows)

**Style:** Technical illustration, emphasizes security/guardrails
**Text:** "Autonomous Agents Within Guardrails"

### Option 4: Agent Network Diagram
**Visual Concept:**
- Flowchart-style diagram showing agent interactions
- Different agent types as different shapes/colors
- Arrows showing data flow and decision points
- Financial elements (payment icons, invoices) integrated
- Modern, clean design

**Style:** Technical diagram aesthetic, professional
**Text:** "Sub-Agent Architecture in Action"

### Option 5: Minimalist with Icon Focus
**Visual Concept:**
- Large, stylized icon representing autonomous agent (robot/neural network)
- Small financial icons (bank, payment, invoice) orbiting around it
- Clean white or gradient background
- Modern, tech-forward aesthetic

**Style:** Minimalist, icon-focused, modern
**Text:** "Agents That Act on Your Behalf"

## Alternative: Screenshot-Based Cover

If you have screenshots of the system, consider:
- Dashboard view showing agent activity
- Payment execution interface
- Agent network visualization from your system
- Overlay with title text

This would be more authentic and show the actual system in action.
